        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; padding-right: 35px;">To sprinkle some background information about myself, I am a passionate designer, photographer and artist with a successful business from the past where I worked at a Kodak Photography Studio and Picture Framing at Auckland City. I am motivated in creating captivated content into the different social media I’ve created such as Facebook and Instagram. In the years I’ve been involved with photography, I’ve learned to appreciate all the small things that make up the beautiful world we live in through my lens I capture special moments with true emotions and translate them into art. I love to show real life. These are the moments we will treasure forever. The best part of my job is that I get to interact and be part of the fun. Each shoot is unique and a new chance for me to share with others my passion for modern, candid style photography. “I appreciate the people I meet, the places I go, the hours I keep and the spontaneity in every shoot. I appreciate the raw reality of everyday life, the fleeting beauty of those in between moments, and I do my very best to take every picture with that in mind. I want my viewers to relate to my photographs through recognition of and familiarity with the situations, the emotions, and the energy so much that they wonder if they are looking at a picture of someone they know”.</p>
